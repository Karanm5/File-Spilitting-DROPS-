**Security and Performance Optimization in Cloud Data Storage**


Outsourcing data to third-party administrative controls, as in cloud computing, introduces significant security risks. Data compromise may occur due to attacks from malicious users or compromised nodes within the cloud. Consequently, robust security measures are essential to safeguard sensitive information. However, these measures must also ensure efficient data retrieval to maintain system performance.

To address these challenges, we propose Division and Replication of Data in the Cloud for Optimal Performance and Security (DROPS), a methodology that simultaneously enhances security and optimizes performance. In DROPS, files are partitioned into fragments, which are then distributed and replicated across multiple cloud nodes. Crucially, each node stores only a single fragment of any given file, ensuring that even in the event of a successful breach, an attacker cannot reconstruct meaningful data from a compromised node.

This approach not only strengthens data confidentiality but also improves fault tolerance and load balancing, thereby optimizing both security and system efficiency
